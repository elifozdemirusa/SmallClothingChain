# Small Clothing Store Chain  
### Python Business Analytics Project

This project is a Python-based business analytics application that simulates the core operations of a small clothing store chain.
It demonstrates data modeling, transaction processing, and exploratory data analysis to support retail decision-making.

The project was developed as part of the M.S. in Business Analytics program at Western New England University.

## Project Overview
The system models real-world retail workflows, including inventory management, customer behavior, employee performance,
and sales transactions. Large synthetic datasets were generated to enable realistic analysis and insights.

---

## Key Features
- Modular Python design using dictionaries and functions
- Customer, item, employee, transaction, and inventory modeling
- Transaction processing with data validation and error handling
- Scalable synthetic data generation (500+ items, 5000+ transactions)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and visualization libraries
- Business-focused analytical questions and insights

---

## Data Model
- Customers: demographic attributes, size preferences, favorite colors
- Items: category, size, price, supplier, barcode, description
- Employees: role, age, store assignment
- Transactions: customer ID, item ID, quantity, total price, employee ID, transaction date
- Inventory: stock levels linked to items

## My Contribution
I was responsible for designing and implementing the item, customer, and transaction components of the system.

My work included:
- Designing scalable data structures for retail entities
- Implementing CRUD-style functions (add, modify, display, search)
- Integrating transactions with customers, employees, and inventory
- Generating large datasets for realistic analysis scenarios
- Preparing clean datasets for exploratory data analysis
- Translating analytical findings into business insights

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis focused on practical retail questions such as:
- Customer age distribution and purchasing behavior
- Employee sales performance and revenue contribution
- Customer spending patterns and high-value customers
- Product color preferences versus customer preferences
- Monthly and annual revenue trends
